Films
=====

I wanted to put [Frontline's film archive](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/view/) into a spreadsheet, so I wrote a little scraper.

To run, clone this repo and:

    $ npm install
    $ node scrape.js > data/films.csv

That's it. I've stored a copy of the downloaded data in `data/films.csv`. Enjoy.
